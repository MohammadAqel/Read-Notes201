# Writing Links

*Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute*

### Linking to Other Sites

*Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.*

### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site

*When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.*

### Relative URLs

*Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.*

## Email Links

*To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to*

### Opening Links in a New Window

*If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.*

### Building Blocks

*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*
